# tradeBench
An application for logging and reviewing trades, made specifically for futures traders who use NinjaTrader.  

### Primary Functions
1. Import and store trade (.csv) and market (.txt) data from NinjaTrader exports.
2. Load and view trade data in a log-style format. 
3. Load and view individual trades on a chart. 

### To-Do
##### Add features:
- Primary key constraints to data tables. 
- Chart scope variance with scroll bar (set viewable range and allow more chart to exist outside viewable range). 
- Click trade # to view chart instead of through file-menu options. 
- Add notes and/or type column options that let you edit in window.
- Hitting cancel in any menu should cause function return.

##### Trouble Shooting: 
- Program indicates "Program not responding" when processing larger data file. 
- File processing is slow. Revisit processing functions and determine how to improve. 

##### Basic Maintenence: 
- Spring Cleaning
- Polish/add documentation.
